Along with the Xbox came Xbox Live, Xbox’s online gaming network that was released in 2002 soon after the release of the first console. It allowed players to compete with others online over the internet and had over two million subscribers. Over the years, Xbox has created multiple upgraded consoles as technology continues to progress. Over the last two decades, Microsoft has released the Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox Kinect, Xbox One, and most recently the Xbox Series. The Xbox 360 was released in 2005, replacing the Xbox. This console faced pressure from the Nintendo Wii and Sony PlayStation while in the competitive market within its initial release, but by 2010 the Xbox 360 became the most played game console in America. A few years, later the Xbox One was released with a more powerful system, which was a flaw of the 360.  </p>
